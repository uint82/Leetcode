Problem #3335: Total Characters in String After Transformation

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer t, return the total number of characters that will exist in s after t transformations modulo 10^9 + 7.

In one transformation, each character is transformed as follows:
- For letters 'a' to 'y', the character is changed to the next letter. For example, 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on.
- The letter 'z' is transformed into both 'a' and 'b', essentially creating two characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
After 1 transformation, "abc" becomes "bcd".
After 2 transformations, "bcd" becomes "cde".
Total characters = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "z", t = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
After 1 transformation, "z" becomes "ab".
After 2 transformations, "ab" becomes "bc".
Total characters = 2 + 2 = 4.

Approach:
- For each transformation, we track how many characters each letter produces.
- Initially, each character in the original string contributes 1 character.
- For letters 'a' to 'y', they transform into the next letter.
- For letter 'z', it transforms into both 'a' and 'b'.
- After computing the number of characters each letter produces after t transformations,
  we sum up the contributions from each character in the original string.

Time Complexity: O(26 * t + n), where n is the length of s and t is the number of transformations.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we use constant extra space regardless of input size.
